### 2. System Health Monitoring
Track CPU, memory, disk, and network performance across your entire fleet. Spot resource issues before they cause downtime.

Built for ROS2 from the ground up. Automatically discover nodes, monitor topics, and track your robot's internal state without writing a single line of code.

### 4. Smart Alerts
